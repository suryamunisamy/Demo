/**
 * Error response resolver to deal with 401-unauthorized cases when the access token has been expired, revoked or
 * flagged as invalid.
 * This resolver will try to refresh the access token, and replay the original request on behave of the original caller.
 *
 * @discussion In cases where the response does not correspond to an expired/invalid token, the token cannot be
 * refreshed or the second attempt to the request fails with the new access token, the resolver simply will mark the
 * request as failed, and the original response will be issued to the original caller. On the other hand, if the token
 * is refreshed properly AND the second attempt to the request is successful the new data will be passed to the original
 * caller as the result of the original request, thus making the refresh token mechanism more transparent for the users.
 *
 * @note This class is thread safe and handle multiple callbacks simultaneously although that could have negative impact
 * on the performance of the server.
