/// Protocol to resolve HTTP error responses.

@required

/**
 * Notifies the conforming object that a response for an HTTP request got an error code this object is registered
 * to handle. This method must call one of the delegate methods when it is done: requestDidFail, or requestDidSucceed.
 * In case of failure, the original error is reported as the reason of failure. In case of success, the new data and
 * response are used as the response of the original request.
 *
 * @discussion This handler allows dealing with cases such as 401-Unauthorized, on which an access token has expired.
 * By handling a 401-unauthorized error, the implementation of this protocol can allow refreshing or reacquiring new
 * tokens and automatically repeat the original request. For whoever originated the request it will be transparent
 * as it will receive the expected information without taking into consider cases where the tokens have been expired.
 *
 * @discussion This method will only ever be invoked if the `canHandlerResponse:data:from` method has returned YES.
 * Which guarantees that the bare minimum information needed to process the challenge is present and valid, so this
 * method can skip the redundant checks and simply extract the data.
 *
 * @warning Only native requests done with NSURLSession.dataTaskWithURL:,
 * NSURLSession.dataTaskWithURL:completionHandler:, NSURLSession.dataTaskWithRequest: or
 * NSURLSession.dataTaskWithRequest:completionHandler: can be held indefinitely until one of methods of the
 * ErrorResponseDelegate is called. Any other requests are subjected to their original timeout.
 * Keep this in mind when designing an ErrorResponseResolver that might require user input, e.g. a step-up or an OTP
 * sent via an SMS platform.
 *
 * @param response Original response received
 * @param data The data retrieved with the response. It might help to determine what to do.
 * @param request The original request that cause the response code. It might be useful to replay the request.
 * @param delegate An object to be notified once the response has been handled.
