/**
 * Content container. It holds information about the content downloaded: origin, type, and requested method (by path
 * or id). It also provides handy methods to retrieve the content on specific formats depending on the developer's
 * needs. The raw data is always available, but with the information on the type property, it's possible to receive
 * a more meaningful representation of the object by invoking the respective property. If the content stream cannot
 * be turned into the property called, it will return nil instead, denoting that was a problem during the conversion.
